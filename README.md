# CSPLib using the Choco Solver
In this repository are some solutions for problems from [CSPLib](http://csplib.org/) implemented in Java using the [Choco solver](http://www.choco-solver.org/).

## Running the project
You just need to clone the project and download and install the choco-solver [(instructions here)](https://choco-solver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_overview.html#using-choco-solver).

## Implemented Problems
Here is a list of the currently implemented problems:

- [006: Golomb Rulers](http://csplib.org/Problems/prob006/) - [GolombRulers.java](src/GolombRulers.java)
- [007: All-Interval Series](http://csplib.org/Problems/prob007/) - [AllIntervals.java](src/AllIntervals.java)
- [054: N-Queens](http://csplib.org/Problems/prob054/) - [NQueens.java](src/NQueens.java)
